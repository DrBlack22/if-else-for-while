/*  IF TEST {BODY}

    The test part of function can contain
    both the variables as well as the
    constants(values).


    Relational/Comparison Operators:
    <
    >
    <=
    >=

    Quality Operators

    One = sign is used for creating variables
    and assigning value to a variable

    So, whenever we are testing, whether
    a variable is equal to the other,
     == double equal signs are used

    != means that a certain variable/constant is
    not equal to the other

    Hence, '==' and '!=' are called equality
    operators.

    Logical Operators

    &&

    ||
